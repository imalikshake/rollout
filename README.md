## BEng Games Project

This repository contains all the source code for our game. However, since we developed this game for equipment and an on-site arena, it will be quite difficult to get it set-up in exactly the same way. You should be able to understand what's going on. Please contact me if you're interested in knowing what the arena looked like and what sort of peripherals (camera, speakers... etc) we used!
